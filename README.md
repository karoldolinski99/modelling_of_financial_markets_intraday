# modelling_of_financial_markets_intraday

Project made in R.

The subject of this project is to investigate the properties of intraday data. Attention will be paid to the intensity of trading in shares of selected listed companies during the trading session and the occurrence of intra-day seasonality of volatility will be checked, along with a possible proposal of a relatively simple method to remove this problem.
